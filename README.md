This is a one use-case python script to solve a very specific problem.[^1]

This script is intended to cut time creating the Kanban Board completely. As of right now, logging a file which you have changed takes only a few seconds, but it adds up over time. This well hopefully organize and do a lot of the heaving lifting. Designed to work with Windows OS.

To make it simpler, this will not edit a .xlsx file itself but export a new CSV to be imported into a .xlsx.
[^1]: The other student assistant and I work very different schedules and we work on a shared project which needs a lot of collaboration. We have to completely rehaul an old directory in a drive on behalf of Access Services. We don't have any way to communicate besides emails and maybe leaving notes in our cubicle. In order to keep track of our progress, I thought it would be a good idea to hava a Kanban board. Initially, I started writing each file out manually on the spreadsheet. I noticed the drive had a ton of files so I wrote this program to make it easier. It was well worth it because the directory has ~12,000 files. I did not feel like doing that manually.
[^2]: The estimation is assuming that for every file in the drive, it would take 3 seconds to manually input into the spreadsheet. It doesn't take in an account for the automatic organizing, mental fatigue from 12000 data entries, having to leave your workspace for a few moments, a human being can perfectly navigate files and enter them into excel in 3 seconds on the dot.
